This approach allows for honing the student’s skills to develop research questions, reflect on their sources, tools, and methods, and critically discuss their frameworks of production as well as of obtained results, and to contextualize these into broader domain-specific frameworks. This thus allows to develop and apply digital literacy and computational competencies early on as key skills of today’s humanities scholarship.\n\n\nI had teaching responsibilities (est. 207 course hours) for both entry- and advanced-level courses in on-site and in virtual formats in the B.Sc. \"Political Science\" program at Technical University of Munich (2017–2020) and in the M.A. \"Digital Methods in the Humanities and Cultural Studies\" program at Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz (from 2022), as well as in various workshops for international and multilingual groups of students.\n\n\n## Graduate courses\n\n\n### Network research theory & practice for studying the human past\n\n**Summer School at Barcelona University, ES**, July 2025\n\nIn the 4-full day [Barcelona Past Networks Summer School](https://www.pastnetworks.net/), an international group of researchers based in Denmark, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, and Spain gave a thorough introduction of the use of network research to study the human past for an international and multidisciplinary group of graduate students. My talks focused on the epistemological implications as well as chances and pitfalls of historical network research, and a practical session on ``Designing your own Network Research Project\".\n\n\n### Historical Network Analysis\n\n**Bring Your Own Data Lab at IEG**, October 2024\n\n<i class=\"ai ai-open-materials\" role=\"img\"></i> [Open Access Materials and Tutorials on GitHub](https://cprog7.github.io/HNR_workshops/) \n\nIn this 2-day workshop of the [\"Exploring Connections\" - Bring Your Own Data Lab by HERMES](https://hermes-hub.de/events/intern/byodlab20240917.html), I presented practical examples to historical network research using Python based on my own research, and an introduction the epistemological framework of modeling for a group of interdisciplinary researchers. I organized a poster session for the participants to conceptualize their own network research projects, and provided individual mentoring on their own datasets. \n\n\n### Network research theory & practice for studying the human past\n\n**Summer School at Barcelona University, ES**, June 2024\n\nIn the 4 full-day long [Barcelona Past Networks Summer School](https://www.pastnetworks.net/), an international group of researchers based in Denmark, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, and Spain gave a thorough introduction of the use of network research to study the human past for an international and multidisciplinary group of graduate students.

Additionally, I introduced the pipeline [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and highlighted its use for publishing reproducible research. \n\n\n### A beginner’s guide to historical network research\n\n**Winter School at IEG**, November 2022 \n\n<i class=\"ai ai-open-materials\" role=\"img\"></i> [Open Access Tutorials on GitHub](https://github.com/ieg-dhr/hnr-winterschool-2022)\n\nIn this (fully online) [winter school](https://ieg-dhr.github.io/hnr-winterschool/) (co-taught with [Dr. Demival Vasques Filho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f8pD2ucAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)), we provided a guide for graduate students and early career researchers interested in the study of social networks with a special focus on historical research questions. This four day course covered the fundamentals of network analysis methods and their underlying theories, the history of historical network research, and covered pitfals in and potentials of network research for the historical studies. We offered hands-on exercises in Python using [Python::NetworkX](https://networkx.org) in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). The winter school was complemented by talks by [Dr. Henrike Rudolph](https://www.sinologie-goettingen.de/seminar/person/dr-henrike-rudolph/) (GAU, GER) on research designs and [Dr. Martin Grandjean](https://www.martingrandjean.ch/) (UNIL, SUI) on network visualization.
