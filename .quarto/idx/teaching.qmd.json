This approach allows for honing the student’s skills to develop research questions, reflect on their sources, tools, and methods, and critically discuss their frameworks of production as well as of obtained results, and to contextualize these into broader domain-specific frameworks. This thus allows to develop and apply digital literacy and computational competencies early on as key skills of today’s humanities scholarship.\n\n\nI had teaching responsibilities for both entry- and advanced-level courses in on-site and in virtual formats in the B.Sc. \"Political Science\" program at Technical University of Munich (2017–2020) and in the M.A. \"Digital Methods in the Humanities and Cultural Studies\" program at Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz (from 2022), as well as in various workshops for international and multilingual groups of students.\n\n\n## Graduate courses\n\n### Historical Network Analysis\n\n**Bring Your Own Data Lab at IEG**, October 2024\n\n<i class=\"ai ai-open-materials\" role=\"img\"></i> [Open Access Materials and Tutorials on GitHub](https://cprog7.github.io/HNR_workshops/) \n\nIn this 2-day workshop of the [\"Exploring Connections\" - Bring Your Own Data Lab by HERMES](https://hermes-hub.de/events/intern/byodlab20240917.html), I presented practical examples to historical network research using Python based on my own research, and an introduction the epistemological framework of modeling for a group of interdisciplinary researchers. I organized a poster session for the participants to conceptualize their own network research projects, and provided individual mentoring on their own datasets. \n\n\n### Network research theory & practice for studying the human past\n\n**Summer School at Barcelona University, ES**, June 2024\n\nIn the 5-day long [Barcelona Past Networks Summer School](https://www.pastnetworks.net/), an international group of researchers based in Denmark, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, and Spain gave a thorough introduction of the use of network research to study the human past for an international and multidisciplinary group of graduate students.
