In March, I finished my tenure as senior convenor of the [working group \"Graphs and Networks\"](https://dig-hum.de/ag-graphen-netzwerke>) of the [DHd](https://dig-hum.de/).\nAs part of the Local Organizing Committe, I organized the [GrapHNR Conference in Mainz](https://graphentechnologien.hypotheses.org/tagungen/graphentechnologien-2023), the session on \"Networks and the Human Past\" at [INSNA SUNBELT 2024 in Edinburgh](https://sunbelt2024.com/organised-sessions/), and taught in the [Barcelona Past Networks Summer Schools 2024 and 2025](https://www.pastnetworks.net/), which is set to be repeated in 2026.\n\n<!--This website was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites).-->\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css","https://cdn.rawgit.com/jpswalsh/academicons/master/css/academicons.min.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"visual","theme":["Simplex","custom.css"],"linkcolor":"#145DA0","title":"Dr. Cindarella Petz","subtitle":"Digital History, Historical Network Research, Text Analysis, Digital Humanities, Computational History"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
