This approach allows for honing the student’s skills to develop research questions, reflect on their sources, tools, and methods, and critically discuss their frameworks of production as well as of obtained results, and to contextualize these into broader domain-specific frameworks. This thus allows to develop and apply digital literacy and computational competencies early on as key skills of today’s humanities scholarship."

There, I proposed modeling as the underlying epistemological framework. With the framework of modeling, my thesis reconceptualizesd computational methodologies for historical research questions and identified modeling as an inherent concept within the historical studies, i.e. the historical narrative as a best-fit model to explain the how and why of history and periodization as models of time-scales as a construct of analysis to sharpen focus, and the use of networks as epistemic tools. In my dissertation, I evaluated the limitations and implications of its epistemological and ontological changes based on two case studies: on the extent of political judiciary in the Austrian “Corporate State”, and on the structural analysis of influence networks of intellectuals.\nAn overview of my publications is recorded at  0000-0002-6178-7332."

    "text": "Analysing network structures of political judiciary\nTags: Network Research, Cluster Analysis, Structural Analysis, Statistics, Data Analysis\nIn “Configuration to Conviction. Network structures of political judiciary in the Austrian Corporate State”, I conceptionalized court records as networks (compare to Figure 1), which allowed me to analyze them structurally. Goal of the analysis was to investigate the extent of political judiciary in the transformed system of the so-called “Corporate State” of Austria. I evaluated differences in the legal prosecution of the political opposition based on over 1800 court trials from 1935 processed at the Viennese provincial courts.\nEvery subsequent analysis I did in R and R-Studio at first, and then fully switched to Python, which allows object-based programming and version-control via Anaconda and GitHub.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: (In Petz and Pfeffer 2021, Fig. 1) The figure on the left shows a multimodal sample network of 88 court proceedings, featuring 201 defendants in 204 cases with verdicts, 55 judges and 27 prosecutors. An edge equals a conviction. On the right: Figure focusing on one defendant in a (randomly chosen) single case’s court trial interpreted as a network. Layout algorithm used: Fruchterman-Rheingold in R::igraph. \n\n\nCombining a formalized network methodology and a quantitative assessment of frequencies and distributions with a qualitative contextualization, I could show different practices of political judiciary at court and specialized strategies to prosecute the political opposition, resulting in a clear bias against left-wing groups and a relative leniency in the conviction of National Socialists based on the evolution of charges in the courts’ actions (compare to Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: (In Petz and Pfeffer 2021, Tab. 7) Networks of co-occurring offenses of members of left- and right-wing political groups. Circular Layout Algorithm used in Python::NetworkX. \n\n\nA multimodal network approach combining statistics, a spectral cluster analysis (Figure 3) and structural analysis, revealed key players and cooperation of judges and prosecutors which accounted for harsher sentences.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: (In Petz and Pfeffer 2021, Fig. 5) Network of judges and prosecutors grouped based on their trials’ court house. An edge symbolizes collaboration in the same processes. A spectral cluster analysis revealed three clusters, as represented in node colors.\n\n\nFinally, in the paper I argue that the system of control over the judiciary and over the political opposition was already crumbling in the Austrian capital in 1935, even before the ’’Anschluss” to NS-Germany in 1938.

I am examining e.g., linguistic strategies towards Social Democratic, Communist, and National Socialist suspects in the statements of police, prosecutors, and judges within the court proceedings. Questions of political and political-confessional marginalisation and (acceptable) deviancy at court will be of particular interest.\nSituated at the interdisciplinary crosspoint of computational history, legal history, and computer linguistics, in this project I am combining historical contextualization with methods from Natural Language Processing, Text and Data Mining methods, utilizing un-/supervised Machine Learning, and LLM-assisted information extraction and argument mining in Python to analyse court records from the 1930s.\nThis work is currently under progress."

This allowed us to re-evaluate, which scholars were most influential based on their structural position, such as centralities and knowledge-brokerage roles (e.g., Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: (In Petz et al 2022, Fig. 4) Frequency distribution of scholars per Region–Era (left), per Era–Discipline (top), and per Region–Discipline (center). Read like: Frequency of scholars with characteristics row and column.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: (In Petz et al 2022, Fig. 9) Evolution of dynamic communities with more than 3 members over eras, starting with Antiquity from the center outwards. The size of nodes represents the amount of memberships.\n\n\nIn “Tracking the Evolution of Communities in a Social Network of Intellectual Influences”, we aimed to identify schools of thought in these intellectual networks by detecting communities, and thus structurally analyzed and evaluated how these communities formed and developed in time, tracking their compositon and characterized the structural patterns of their dynamic evolution (e.g., Figure 5). We contextualized the changes in selected network structures in order to establish the merit of this method for a new perspective on the history of intellectuals, their influences, and their ideas (e.g., Figure 6).\n\n\n\nFigure 6: (In Petz et al 2022, Fig. 5) Medieval period influence networks of two sub-samples of scholars located in AR and EU, respectively."
